    "As the capital city of Canada, Toronto has a flourishing business landscape and consistently attracts new players because of the attractive market and potential opportunities. This also means that the market is very competitive which lowers margins and increases the effort required to be successful. Rash investment decision making will not get you anywhere here, but strategic and well-planned actions stands to make your business and lower the investment risk."

    "##### 1.1 Aims\n",
    "In this report, we will consider the fictive retail chain **Good Purchase**, who are well-established in other regions of Canada but has yet to establish themselves in Toronto. With a well-functioning business model and concept, they have proven themselves as a viable business in other markets but as with all new market establishment, they need their first store opening in Toronto to be a successful one. This would enable them to continue expansion throughout Toronto, replicating the opening strategies from their first store.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure success, Good Purchase has enlisted the help of a data scientist team with the objective to **determine and recommend the most suitable neighbourhood of Toronto to open their first store in**. Along with the engagement letter, Good Purchase has hinted that from their previous operations in other geographies they know that the **two most important factors for retail success are:**\n",
    "1. Low local competition (=low # of stores),\n",
    "2. High demand (=high population)."

    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will be collecting the data by scraping (mainly Wikipedia) web pages containing the demographic and neighbourhood segmentations. We will append this dataset using open-source coordinate API:s to collect the geographical coordinates of each neighbourhood. This, in turn, will allow us to utilise the Foursquare API to collect information about existing competing businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect when collecting data in this manner is to properly clean, check and verify the integrity of the dataset. Hence, in every collection step we will pause and ensure that the newly collected data meets the standards we want, and if not, retrace our steps and recollect missing data.\n",

    "Instead of finding the neighbourhood with the lowest competition and highest demand, we will use a clustering technique (e.g. k-means or DBSCAN) to identify a cluster of neighbourhoods that stands out with respect to the potential of opening a store. This will in addition to answer the client's immediate question also give a road map to potential future openings."

    "Finally, we collected detailed information on the various businesses in each neighbourhood using the Foursquare API. After cleaning and proccessing this dataset we extracted a competition score which represents the level of competing businesses within the market segment that our client Good Purchase operates in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in our analysis was to use k-means clustering to cluster the neighbourhoods into segments with similar competition and population. Our client wants to expand into a high demand - low supply environment, so this analysis allowed us to identify not only one suitable candidate, but an entire set of candidates."

    "Specifically, we searched for neighbourhoods with high population (=high demand) and low competition (=low supply). Our analysis showed that cluster number 4 had these desired properties, and our **final recommendation to the client therefore is to consider opening within one of Woburn, Old East York, Agincourt, Elia or L'Amoureaux.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Further expansion after this can preferably take place within the same cluster (i.e. the neighbourhoods listed above) to provide adept geographical coverage, but the main recommendation for this case is to re-evaluate the neighbourhoods when this is up for discussion to account for any recent changes in the market landscape."

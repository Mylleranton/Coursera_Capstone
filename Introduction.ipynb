    "##### 1. Background\n",
    "As the capital city of Canada, Toronto has a flourishing business landscape and consistently attracts new players because of the attractive market and potential opportunities. This also means that the market is very competitive which lowers margins and increases the effort required to be successful. Rash investment decision making will not get you anywhere here, but strategic and well-planned actions stands to make your business and lower the investment risk."

    "##### 1.1 Aims\n",
    "In this report, we will consider the fictive retail chain **Good Purchase**, who are well-established in other regions of Canada but has yet to establish themselves in Toronto. With a well-functioning business model and concept, they have proven themselves as a viable business in other markets but as with all new market establishment, they need their first store opening in Toronto to be a successful one. This would enable them to continue expansion throughout Toronto, replicating the opening strategies from their first store.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure success, Good Purchase has enlisted the help of a data scientist team with the objective to **determine and recommend the most suitable neighbourhood of Toronto to open their first store in**. Along with the engagement letter, Good Purchase has hinted that from their previous operations in other geographies they know that the **two most important factors for retail success are:**\n",
    "1. Low local competition (=low # of stores),\n",
    "2. High demand (=high population)."

    "##### 2.1 Data description and collection\n",
    "For this project, we need to collect, investigate and cluster the neighbourhoods of Toronto along with their corresponding demographic data and geodata of existing retail stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will be collecting the data by scraping (mainly Wikipedia) web pages containing the demographic and neighbourhood segmentations. We will append this dataset using open-source coordinate API:s to collect the geographical coordinates of each neighbourhood. This, in turn, will allow us to utilise the Foursquare API to collect information about existing competing businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect when collecting data in this manner is to properly clean, check and verify the integrity of the dataset. Hence, in every collection step we will pause and ensure that the newly collected data meets the standards we want, and if not, retrace our steps and recollect missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we will end up with a dataset containing:\n",
    "* Neighbourhood ID\n",
    "* Neighbourhood Name\n",
    "* Neighbourhood geographical coordinates\n",
    "* Neighbourhood population\n",
    "* Competing Venue Name\n",
    "* Competing Venue Category\n",
    "* Competing Venue geographical coordinates"

    "##### 2.2 Methodology\n",
    "To be able to answer the posed question, we will build our analysis on the **two fundamental pillars** set out by Good Purchase, namely that a good neighbourhood will have low competition and high demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of finding the neighbourhood with the lowest competition and highest demand, we will use a clustering technique (e.g. k-means or DBSCAN) to identify a cluster of neighbourhoods that stands out with respect to the potential of opening a store. This will in addition to answer the client's immediate question also give a road map to potential future openings."
